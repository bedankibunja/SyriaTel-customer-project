    "### Project overview\n",
    "The project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (stop doing business) from SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. Churn prediction is crucial for the company because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting churn, the company can proactively take steps to retain customers, thereby reducing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The core problem is to develop a binary classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer will churn. Given that customer churn can significantly impact the company's profitability, identifying patterns and factors that contribute to churn is essential. The challenge lies in analyzing the available customer data to uncover insights that can help in formulating strategies to minimize churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "Analyze customer data to identify key features and patterns that contribute to churn.\n",
    "Develop and validate a binary classification model that predicts customer churn with high accuracy.\n",
    "Provide actionable insights and recommendations for SyriaTel to implement targeted retention strategies based on the model's findings.\n",
    "Evaluate the business impact of the predictive model by estimating potential revenue saved through early identification and intervention for at-risk customers."
